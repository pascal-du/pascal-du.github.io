                <strong>Abstract:</strong> This project studies the problem of network hardening in industrial control systems (ICSs) given an administrator having limited resources to allocate.
                ICSs are a frequent target of attacks because of their importance to infrastructure and their notoriety for utilising legacy systems.
                Honeypots (HPs) have been used as a form of intrusion detection system which can detect a vast swathe of possible attacks.
                However, given that the administrator can only afford to have a select number HPs within a system, an allocation technique is required.
                I propose a game-theoretic framework, which models a defender and attacker against each other, both attempting to maximise their stated goals.
                This is done through a reward function that rewards the defender for successfully intercepting an attack, but penalises it for non-interceptions.
                The attacker's reward function is the direct inverse of this and as such this game is what is called a Zero-Sum game.
                The creation and preparation of the game-action space is done by utilising a novel graph generator and reducing it through creating what are known as CAGs so that the complexity of the action space is reasonable for large network sizes.
                Analysis is conducted on various graph topology sizes in evaluating the performance and scalability of the model, including varying key parameters and their effects on the game outcome.

                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Using the LED diffusion model as a framework, we evaluate its effectiveness in enhancing low quality chest x-rays (CXR).
                The dataset used is a subset of the PadChest dataset containing 1000 super-negative exposure (low-quality) CXR images, and 1000 near-zero exposure (high-quality).
                Following the LED framework, we first implement a CycleGAN to learn a degradation mapping between unpaired high-quality and low-quality images, creating a paired dataset of high-quality images and their generated mapping.
                Then a conditional diffusion model is trained to learn the inverse. Evaluating on a pre-trained ResNet-18 model, our enhancing diffuser demonstrates improvement in diagnostic accuracy on low-quality CXRs from 56.6% to 66.3%, narrowing most of the gap to high-quality images (73.9%).
