        <h2>Background & Education</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at [Your University], with an
            expected graduation date of [Month Year]. My coursework has focused on data structures, algorithms,
            and software engineering. I have also completed electives in machine learning and distributed
            systems.

        <h2>Interests & Skills</h2>
        <p>
            My primary research interests include algorithmic optimization and scalable web architectures. I
            am proficient in Python, Java, and JavaScript, and have experience building RESTful APIs using
            Node.js. Outside of academics, I enjoy contributing to open‐source projects and exploring new
            front‐end frameworks.

        <h2>Goals & Aspirations</h2>
        <p>
            In the coming years, I aim to participate in collaborative research on machine‐learning models
            for natural‐language processing. I am particularly interested in applying theoretical insights to
            real‐world problems in data science and software engineering.
